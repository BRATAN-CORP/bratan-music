# Go port — status board

Updated per commit. Anything `❌` returns HTTP 501 from the Go binary;
the TS `worker/` service remains the source of truth for that endpoint
until parity is reached.

## Cut-over plan

1. Land all ❌ rows as `✅` in follow-up commits on this same branch.
2. Drop `worker/` directory + worker-specific CI bits.
3. Point nginx upstream from `api:3000` → `api-go:3000`, delete the
   side-by-side `api-go:3001` port mapping.
4. Unset draft on this PR and merge.
